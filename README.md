## Brief:   
Research conducted on "the concept of Artificial Neural Networks and their application in computer games" lead into implementation of a neural network. The simulation was developed in Unity game engine using C# programming language. The development led to the creation of a neural network able to teach itself how to drive a car and successfully complete a track.
